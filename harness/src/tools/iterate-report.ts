/**
 * Report authoring tools for the conversation agent: `plan_report` + `submit_report`.
 *
 * WHY TWO TOOLS. The report brief (title/audience/sources plus the section
 * union — narrative/metrics/figure/table/chart, each with its own
 * encoding/transform/asset sub-fields) is a ~12k-char JSON schema. Every
 * registered tool's schema ships on EVERY conversation turn, so parking that
 * brief on an always-on tool would tax every turn for a tool used only when a
 * report is actually built. We split the single former tool in two and deliver
 * the heavy schema just-in-time:
 *
 *  - `plan_report` — a tiny, always-on trigger (no-arg). Its `execute` RETURNS
 *    the brief schema (`z.toJSONSchema(ReportBriefSchema)`) plus the authoring
 *    rules as its tool RESULT, so the full contract enters context only on a
 *    report-building turn — and thereafter rides in the cached history prefix,
 *    not at full price on every request.
 *  - `submit_report` — takes the composed brief and does the real work
 *    (pre-flight staging, previewId/versioning, `runReportIteration`, preview
 *    publishing). It accepts the brief as `unknown` so the 12k schema stays off
 *    the always-on surface, then validates it against `ReportBriefSchema` INSIDE
 *    `execute`, returning `{ ok: false, issues }` as DATA the model can fix (not
 *    a thrown error). That is the same trade `validate_plan` makes: a runtime
 *    contract in exchange for keeping the schema out of every request. The small
 *    iterate-mode + common fields (modifications / previewId / baseVersion /
 *    sources / format) stay fully typed — they cost little and guide iteration.
 *
 * On a valid brief, `submit_report`'s behaviour is identical to the former
 * `iterate_report`: two modes (Create v1 via `report`; Iterate v2+ via
 * `modifications` + `previewId`), pre-flight stages every source into the
 * preview's assets/ dir, and it emits a `data-report-preview` chat data part on
 * success or `data-report-preview-failed` on pre-flight/builder failure. The
 * hosted preview surface is reached through an injected `PreviewPublisher` seam
 * (managed default mints a short-lived run-authorization grant; local default
 * returns "unavailable"). The 4 custom report tools the builder drives are
 * constructed inside `runReportIteration` — see design.md Decision #9.
 *
 * Naming note: the report-builder SUB-agent has its OWN same-id `submit_report`
 * terminal tool (`tools/report/submit-report.ts`). The two never share a tool
 * roster — this one is the conversation agent's brief-submission entry point;
 * that one is the builder's finalize gate.

const REPORT_AUTHORING_RULES = `# Composing a report brief

The report-builder agent NEVER sees the analysis tree — it receives only the
brief you compose, so the brief must be complete. You write the prose, the
numbers, and the chart encodings; the builder only does layout and visual
treatment. Pass the composed brief as \`submit_report\`'s \`report\` field.

## Create vs iterate
- CREATE (v1): pass \`report\` (this brief), omit \`previewId\`. Every CSV / image /
  JSON the report renders goes in \`report.sources\` — pre-flight stages each into
  the preview's assets/ dir and parses its columns, first 5 rows, and row count
  into the brief for you.
- ITERATE (v2+): pass \`modifications\` (natural-language change instructions)
  plus the existing \`previewId\`, and NEVER \`report\` — passing \`report\` builds a
  fresh report and discards all prior work. New data files go in the top-level
  \`sources\`. \`baseVersion\` branches from an earlier version instead of the latest.

## Sources
- Every file the report renders — CSV/TSV, PNG/SVG, JSON — must be listed in
  \`sources\`. A section's \`imageAsset\` / \`dataAsset\` must name one of these staged
  assets (its \`as\`, or the basename of its \`path\`) or the call fails.
- Markdown is NOT a source. Keep summary.md / synthesis.json out of \`sources\`;
  their content reaches the report as prose you write into \`narrative\` /
  \`methods\` sections.

## Do NOT reach for run_ephemeral first
- Not to peek at a CSV — pre-flight already parsed its columns and head rows.
- Not to filter, slice, rank, or derive columns from a single CSV about to be
  rendered — \`chart.content.transform\` and \`table.content.transform\` do exactly
  that client-side, and the transform text renders as a provenance footnote.
- run_ephemeral is only for computation no single section transform covers:
  cross-file aggregation, statistics needing a real numerical library, or a
  derived CSV the report then lists as a fresh source.

## Choosing a section type
- narrative — prose you wrote: context, story, interpretation.
- methods — prose you wrote: what was done, how, with which parameters.
- metrics — labeled headline numbers you already derived (the builder does not
  compute them).
- table — a tabular asset rendered as a table; pick a column subset + topN that
  fit the audience.
- chart — a tabular asset (or inline rows) rendered as an interactive ECharts
  plot. PREFER chart over figure whenever the data file exists — a chart is
  interactive, themed, and re-encodable on iteration.
- figure — a static image the analysis already produced (PNG/SVG). Reach for it
  only when the user asks for the existing image, the visual is genuinely
  image-only, or the image carries annotations the data does not.

## Inline chart data
\`chart.content.data\` is an escape hatch for a cross-file aggregate you computed
yourself from files you ACTUALLY read. Prefer \`dataAsset\`. Never fabricate or
estimate values — every inline value must come from a file you read, and cite
the real files in \`data.source\`. More than one inline-data chart per report is a
smell — persist the aggregate as a derived CSV instead.

## Result
\`submit_report\` returns the preview id + version and emits a preview card.
Pre-flight and builder failures come back as an \`error\` string on the result,
not as a thrown error. An invalid brief comes back as \`{ ok: false, issues }\` —
fix the named fields and resubmit.`;
