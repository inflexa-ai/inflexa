## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The knowledge client is an optional seam

The harness MUST declare a `KnowledgeClient` interface with three operations: `recommend(situation)`, `check(situation, steps)`, and `render(template, slots, farm?)`. The harness MUST ship `createHttpKnowledgeClient({ baseUrl, apiKey })` as the realization over HTTPS with the retry and timeout policy of the other external tools. An embedder MUST bind a client at its composition root, or none. The harness MUST NOT read a license, a key, or an endpoint from the environment.

#### Scenario: No client is bound

- **GIVEN** a composition root that binds no knowledge client
- **WHEN** the planner tools and the sandbox agents are built
- **THEN** no knowledge tool attaches, no description of one enters the context, and every plan validates as before

#### Scenario: A client is bound

- **GIVEN** a composition root that binds a knowledge client
- **WHEN** the planner tools are built
- **THEN** the search tools of the planner hold `knowledge_recommend` and `knowledge_check`

### Requirement: Every service outcome is a data variant

Each operation of the client MUST answer a typed value and MUST NOT throw on a service outcome. An unreachable service, a timeout, a 5xx, or an answer that does not match the contract MUST give `{ match: "unavailable", reason }` after the retry policy. A 400 MUST give `{ match: "rejected", message, issues }` where each issue names the field or the slot and the permitted values.

#### Scenario: The service is unreachable

- **GIVEN** a client at an endpoint that does not answer
- **WHEN** `knowledge_recommend` runs
- **THEN** the tool result is `{ match: "unavailable" }` and the loop continues

#### Scenario: A slot value is refused

- **GIVEN** a render request with a value outside the enumeration of a slot
- **WHEN** `knowledge_template` runs
- **THEN** the tool result is `{ match: "rejected" }` with the slot and the permitted values, and no file is written

### Requirement: The check is bounded and a stated outcome satisfies a flag

`knowledge_check` MUST count its calls inside one plan generation and MUST answer `{ match: "rejected" }` without a call to the service past `CHECK_CALL_LIMIT` calls. A drafted step MUST accept an optional `outcome` field, and the service MUST NOT report a violation for a flag that removes inference when the drafted step states that outcome, in the field or in its method text.

#### Scenario: A planner rephrases a step it cannot satisfy

- **GIVEN** a plan generation that ran `CHECK_CALL_LIMIT` checks
- **WHEN** the planner calls `knowledge_check` again
- **THEN** the tool answers `{ match: "rejected" }` with a message that tells the planner to submit, and the service receives no request

#### Scenario: A descriptive step on a design without replicates

- **GIVEN** a situation with one sample in a group
- **WHEN** the planner drafts a differential expression step with `outcome: "descriptive_only"`, or with a method text that says the step is descriptive
- **THEN** the check reports no violation for that step

### Requirement: The situation is typed and carries no data

The input of `knowledge_recommend` and `knowledge_check` MUST be the flat situation schema: enumerated fields for the question, the modality, the data state, the count source, the organism, the batch structure, the library type, the strandedness, and the quality flags, plus the group and replicate counts, the pairing, the blocking factor, the covariates, the time points, and the interaction flag. The tool MUST NOT accept a sample identifier, a file path, or free text.

#### Scenario: An absent optional field is omitted

- **GIVEN** a call without `covariates`
- **WHEN** the tool sends the situation
- **THEN** the request carries no `covariates` key

### Requirement: The template tool writes through the mutator

`knowledge_template` MUST send the template reference, the slot values, and the package versions of the farm, and it MUST write the rendered script under `scripts/` and the decision record at `output/decision_record.json` through the `WorkspaceMutator` of the step with the tool name `knowledge_template`. The tool MUST run in `workflow` execution mode. The tool MUST attach only when a client is bound and the agent holds a mutator.

#### Scenario: A render lands two files

- **GIVEN** a bound client that renders a template
- **WHEN** the tool runs with valid slot values
- **THEN** the script and the decision record exist in the working directory, the result names both paths and the environment match, and the provenance record of each write names `knowledge_template`

#### Scenario: A read-only agent gets no template tool

- **GIVEN** an agent built with `readOnly: true`
- **WHEN** its tools resolve
- **THEN** `knowledge_template` is absent

### Requirement: The plan step carries an optional grounding

`AnalysisStepSchema` and `PlanStepSchema` MUST carry an optional `grounding` object with `status` (`grounded`, `ungrounded`, `flagged`), `snapshot`, `claims`, an optional `template`, and `reason`. A plan without the field MUST validate as before. The briefing MUST render the field beside the task fields.

#### Scenario: A stored plan without grounding loads

- **GIVEN** a plan persisted before the field existed
- **WHEN** it is loaded and validated
- **THEN** validation passes

#### Scenario: A grounded step reaches its agent

- **GIVEN** a step with a grounding that names a template
- **WHEN** the briefing composes
- **THEN** the seed carries the status, the template, the snapshot, the claims, and the reason
