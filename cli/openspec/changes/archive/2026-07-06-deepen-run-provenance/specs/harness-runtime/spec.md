# harness-runtime Specification (delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Local realizations for every analysis-run dependency

The composition SHALL realize the sandbox-step and execute-analysis dep bundles from
deliberate local wiring, reusing the data-profile realizations where the seams are
shared (pool, chat provider, sandbox client, workspace filesystem, session-tree base,
model id, bio keys, local run authorizer). Specific to the run engine:

- The embedding dependency SHALL be a real `EmbeddingProvider` instance constructed
  from the same cli embedding config the profile path uses.
- The run-level billing bracket SHALL be the harness's no-op `RunCharge`.
- The agent builder SHALL resolve each step's agent id against the harness sandbox
  agent catalog, threading the per-step build context (sandbox ref, write prefix,
  lineage collector, blocker holder, function-id/deadline accessors) into the
  catalog's agent deps; an agent id absent from the catalog SHALL fail the step with
  the known-id list.
- The step write prefix SHALL resolve to the harness's `runs/{runId}/{stepId}` path
  convention under the analysis's session tree.
- The artifact registry SHALL be the provenance bus adapter (see
  `prov-harness-bridge`): registration emits `prov.file_written` /
  `prov.input_used` bus events feeding the analysis's signed tsprov document, and
  sync stays a local no-op. The adapter never touches harness-owned tables and never
  emits step lifecycle events.
- `ExecuteAnalysisDeps.emitProvenance` SHALL be realized as the bus mapping for all
  three lifecycle arms (`prov.run_started` / `prov.step_completed` /
  `prov.run_completed` with the system actor and pass-through timestamps — see
  `prov-harness-bridge`).
- No dependency SHALL be realized as a fake that fabricates success.

#### Scenario: Run deps resolve to their designated backends

- **WHEN** the runtime composes the sandbox-step and execute-analysis dep bundles
- **THEN** chat traffic targets the local proxy, embedding traffic targets the configured embeddings endpoint, and everything else requires only the local Postgres and the Docker daemon

#### Scenario: Step agents come from the harness catalog

- **WHEN** a run step declares agent id `bulk-transcriptomics-agent` (a catalog id)
- **THEN** the built agent is the catalog's definition for that id, wired with the step's sandbox, write prefix, and lineage collector

#### Scenario: Unknown agent id fails visibly

- **WHEN** a step's agent id is not in the catalog (defense-in-depth — plan validation gates this upstream)
- **THEN** the step fails with an error naming the unknown id and the known ids, rather than running a fallback agent

#### Scenario: Registration feeds the signed document without failing the step

- **WHEN** a step's post-step pipeline registers its artifacts through the bus adapter
- **THEN** the file and used-input provenance events are emitted, the result reports the registered paths with their PROV QNames as external ids and zero failures, the local `cortex_artifacts` ledger write (owned by the harness around the seam) proceeds normally, and the step completes — its step activity arriving separately from the scheduler settlement
