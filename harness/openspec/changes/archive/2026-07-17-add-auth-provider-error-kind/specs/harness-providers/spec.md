## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Provider failures are returned as a classified ProviderError value

A provider failure from the AI SDK runtime SHALL be returned in the harness error channel as a `ProviderError` in the discriminated union `{ type: "auth" } | { type: "budget" } | { type: "tenant-blocked" } | { type: "provider" }`, never as an unclassified SDK exception. Classification SHALL preserve the existing retryability semantics: auth, budget, and tenant-blocked are not retryable, transient rate-limit/5xx/connection failures are retryable provider failures, other concrete 4xx failures are non-retryable provider failures. A provider `401` — read from the failure itself or from anywhere on its `cause` chain — SHALL classify as `auth`, and the wrapped `auth` message SHALL name the credential as the broken thing (expired, revoked, or absent), never the request. Classification SHALL key on the HTTP status only, never on provider message text. A client abort SHALL be re-thrown verbatim rather than classified.

#### Scenario: An expired credential 401 is a non-retryable auth error

- **GIVEN** a provider 401 response (e.g. the local proxy's provider OAuth credential expired and refresh failed)
- **WHEN** the failure is classified
- **THEN** the `ProviderError` has `type: "auth"` and `retryable: false`, and its message names the credential rather than the request

#### Scenario: A 401 nested on the cause chain still classifies as auth

- **GIVEN** an `AI_APICallError` wrapper whose `cause` carries `statusCode: 401`
- **WHEN** the failure is classified
- **THEN** the `ProviderError` has `type: "auth"` and `retryable: false`

#### Scenario: A budget error is a non-retryable ProviderError value

- **GIVEN** a budget failure from the configured AI SDK provider
- **WHEN** the model call runs
- **THEN** it resolves to an `err` whose `ProviderError` has `type: "budget"` and `retryable: false`

#### Scenario: A blocked tenant maps to tenant-blocked

- **GIVEN** a tenant authorization failure from the configured AI SDK provider
- **WHEN** the failure is classified
- **THEN** the `ProviderError` has `type: "tenant-blocked"` and `retryable: false`

#### Scenario: A transient upstream error is retryable

- **GIVEN** a provider 503 response
- **WHEN** the failure is classified
- **THEN** the `ProviderError` has `type: "provider"` with `retryable: true`

#### Scenario: A client abort escapes the error channel

- **GIVEN** an aborted `AbortSignal` during a model call
- **WHEN** the SDK raises the abort
- **THEN** the call re-throws it verbatim rather than returning an `err(ProviderError)`
