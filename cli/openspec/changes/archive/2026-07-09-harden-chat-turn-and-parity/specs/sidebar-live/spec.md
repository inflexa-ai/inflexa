# sidebar-live — Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Sidebar data refreshes on lifecycle edges and bounded polling

The sidebar's live data SHALL refresh when the runtime reaches `ready`, when the workspace analysis
changes, when a chat turn completes, and when the profile parity machinery changes ledger state outside
those edges (a trigger, restart, or clear pokes the store — see `tui-harness-chat`); while the last
snapshot shows active work (a pending/running profile or a non-terminal run) it SHALL additionally poll
on a bounded interval — and SHALL stop polling once no work is active, so an idle sidebar issues zero
queries.

A refresh SHALL claim a monotonic generation token at entry and re-check it after each read, so the
newest refresh started is the only one that writes. Because that token makes a newer refresh *cancel* an
older one, the **poll** SHALL additionally skip its tick whenever a refresh is already in flight. Without
that skip, reads slower than the interval would leave every tick superseded by the next and the store
would never receive a write at all — and since an `unavailable` snapshot is itself an arming condition,
a degraded database would be re-queried on every tick behind a permanently frozen section.

Lifecycle-edge refreshes SHALL NOT skip: they carry new information and are required to supersede.

#### Scenario: A run launched from chat appears without user action

- **WHEN** the agent launches a run during a turn
- **THEN** the RUNS section shows the new run after the turn completes, and its status keeps updating while the run is active

#### Scenario: An input edit's consequences appear without user action

- **WHEN** an input mutation causes the parity machinery to re-trigger or clear the profile
- **THEN** the DATA PROFILE section reflects the new ledger state (running, or not profiled) without the user touching the sidebar

#### Scenario: Idle costs nothing

- **WHEN** no profile is running and every run is terminal
- **THEN** no polling interval is active

#### Scenario: A slow read degrades cadence, not liveness

- **WHEN** a refresh's ledger reads take longer than the poll interval
- **THEN** the intervening ticks SHALL be skipped rather than superseding the in-flight refresh
- **AND** that refresh SHALL complete and write its snapshots

#### Scenario: A recovering database self-heals

- **WHEN** the ledger reads fail (arming the poll via `unavailable`) and then begin succeeding, while each read is slower than the interval
- **THEN** a refresh SHALL complete and the sections SHALL leave the `unavailable` state
