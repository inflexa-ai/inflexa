# Delta: report-render

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The number format of a resolved value

The kind resolution MUST read a declared column meaning first, and the name guess is the fallback for an undeclared column. A declared meaning replaces the name test alone, and the magnitude arms stay. Thus a declared column renders byte-identically to a name-matched column of the same nature.

#### Scenario: A declared meaning beats the name guess

- **WHEN** the caller renders a small numeric cell of a column declared `p-value`, whose name matches no token
- **THEN** the cell renders in the scientific kind, and the `title` attribute holds the full digits

#### Scenario: The magnitude arms survive a declaration

- **WHEN** the caller renders `0.536` in a column declared `p-value`
- **THEN** the cell shows `0.536`, exactly as a token-matched p-value column shows it

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A declared display label names the column

The table header MUST show the declared label of a column, with the raw column name in the `title` attribute of the header. An axis whose channel reads a labeled column MUST carry the label as its axis title. An undeclared header MUST prettify as the fallback: underscores become spaces, with the raw name on hover when the two differ. An undeclared axis keeps the raw name.

#### Scenario: The header shows the label with the raw name on hover

- **WHEN** the table view renders a column declared with a display label
- **THEN** the header shows the label, and the `title` attribute of the header holds the raw name

#### Scenario: The axis carries the label

- **WHEN** the chart derivation names an axis for a channel whose column carries a declared label
- **THEN** the axis title is the label, and the derivation stays deterministic

#### Scenario: An undeclared header prettifies

- **WHEN** the table view renders the column `gene_symbol` with no declared label
- **THEN** the header shows `gene symbol`, and the `title` attribute of the header holds the raw name
