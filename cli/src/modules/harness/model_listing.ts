// on every open, and it must speak whatever protocol the CONFIGURED connection uses — the owned
// cliproxy, a direct OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or a direct Anthropic endpoint — not just the proxy.
//
// Homed here, not in proxy/models.ts, because it needs the resolved model connection
// (`ResolvedModelConnection`, harness-owned): a proxy/models.ts helper reaching into harness/config
// would invert the harness → proxy module dependency direction (CLAUDE.md). It reuses proxy's
// `readApiKey` (the cliproxy client-key discovery) for the cliproxy mode only.
//
// Listing failure is an EXPECTED outcome — the picker degrades to free-text entry — so every
// failure mode is modeled on the Result error channel, never thrown.

// Every supported endpoint answers the OpenAI-style `{ data: [{ id }] }` shape: the cliproxy /models
// route, an OpenAI-compatible /models, AND Anthropic's GET /v1/models (whose `data[].id` carries the
